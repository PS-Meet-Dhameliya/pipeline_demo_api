        "description": "The aim of Directive 90/385/EEC is to ensure a high level of protection for human health and safety, smooth operation of the single market and to achieve the results for which the active implantable medical devices are intended. It does this by harmonising national legislation on active implantable medical devices. This ensures universally high safety standards for patients, giving the public confidence in the system. It enables the products to be used in any European Union (EU) country. Please note that Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices has repealed Directive 90/385/EEC and begun to apply from 26 May 2021. Nevertheless, Article 120 of the Regulation provides for a transitional period allowing medical devices, under specified conditions (e.g., placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021), to continue to comply with the Directive. In accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 120, this period ends 26 May 2025.",

It extends the application of international rules to national transport of dangerous goods.

The ADR, RID and ADN have drawn up a list of dangerous goods, indicating whether their transport is prohibited or not and defining the requirements for their transport if it is authorized.",

Fertilisers that meet this type designation may be sold and used throughout the EU. For a new type designation to be listed in Annex I, the manufacturer must submit a request with a national competent authority, which is then forwarded to the European Commission, which consults the other EU countries and decides to accept or reject the application.

Specifically, it harmonises national legislation on medical devices. This ensures universally high safety standards for patients, giving the public confidence in the system. It enables the products to be used in any European Union country. Please note that Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices has repealed Directive 93/42/EEC and begun to apply from 26 May 2021. Nevertheless, Article 120 of the Regulation provides for a transitional period allowing medical devices, under specified conditions (e.g., placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021), to continue to comply with the Directive. In accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 120, this period ends 26 May 2025.",

It opens the single market for new fertilising products, such as organic and organo-mineral fertilisers, soil improvers, inhibitors, plant biostimulants, growing media or blends. It also introduces limits for toxic contaminants for the first time. The Regulation does not prevent non-harmonised fertilising products from being made available on the EU market in accordance with national law and the general free-movement rules. Starting 16 July 2022, the Regulation replaces Regulation 2003/2003/EC.",
